  "title": "Autocomplete Feature for Search Engine",
  "description": "You are tasked with designing an autocomplete feature for a search engine. The feature should provide a list of suggestions based on the input prefix. The suggestions should be retrieved from a given list of words. The feature should be case-insensitive and should handle duplicate words.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": {
        "words": [
          "apple",
          "app",
          "application",
          "banana",
          "bat"
        ],
        "prefix": "ap"
      },
      "output": [
        "apple",
        "app",
        "application"
      ],
      "explanation": "The output includes all words that start with the prefix 'ap' (case-insensitive)."
    },
    {
      "input": {
        "words": [
          "hello",
          "world",
          "hell",
          "word"
        ],
        "prefix": "he"
      },
      "output": [
        "hello",
        "hell"
      ],
      "explanation": "The output includes all words that start with the prefix 'he' (case-insensitive)."
    },
    {
      "input": {
        "words": [
          "test",
          "testing",
          "tester",
          "testify"
        ],
        "prefix": "te"
      },
      "output": [
        "test",
        "testing",
        "tester",
        "testify"
      ],
      "explanation": "The output includes all words that start with the prefix 'te' (case-insensitive)."
    }
  ],
  "constraints": {
    "words": "The list of words will contain at most 10000 unique words.",
    "word_length": "Each word will have a length between 1 and 100 characters.",
    "prefix_length": "The prefix will have a length between 1 and 100 characters.",
    "time_complexity": "The solution should have a time complexity of O(n + m) where n is the number of words and m is the number of characters in the prefix."
  },
  "follow_up": [
    "How would you handle a large list of words that does not fit into memory?",
    "How would you optimize the solution to provide suggestions in real-time as the user types?"
  ],
  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "category": "Trie",
  "hints": [
    "Use a Trie data structure to store the words and provide efficient lookup and retrieval of suggestions.",
    "Use a case-insensitive comparison to handle words with different cases.",
    "Consider using a recursive approach to traverse the Trie and retrieve suggestions."
